The marathon 2020 NHL draft has come and gone taking up nearly an entire day of hardcore hockey fans' lives. 217 talented kids go home - or, I guess I should say, stay at home - with part 1 of their childhood dream realized, while hundreds of others will hopefully use the disappointment of not hearing their names called as added motivation going into next season.

When teams are selecting the players they would like to add to their organization, things like talent, skill set, character, and team needs all factor in to some degree. However, there is another big factor (especially among late-round picks) that affects who is selected or not: **league**. And I'm not talking about playing against men vs juniors or the quality of league, but how the collective bargaining agreement negatively impacts CHL player draft stock. Let me explain.

# The CBA

The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is a contract between the NHL and the NHLPA 

Per [the NHL CBA](https://www.nhlpa.com/the-pa/cba):

1. Teams hold the rights of drafted players from the CHL for 2 years.

2. Teams hold the rights of drafted players who are in or plan to play in the NCAA until the end of their college eligibility.

3. Teams hold the rights of drafted players from non-Russian European leagues for 4 years.

4. Teams hold the rights of drafted players from Russian leagues indefinitely.

Upon finishing juniors in 1-3 years, the team must sign the player to continue development taking up a roster spot

Do not lose rights of college player until finished school

# Optimizing the System: Toronto Maple Leafs

They are a team that can make a large investment into their players


This is not a knock on the Leafs or the players they took. The Leafs are acting in their best strategic interest and all of these players are extremely talented

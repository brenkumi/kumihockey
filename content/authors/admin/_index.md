I am an aspiring data scientist that has recently graduated from McMaster University with Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Statistics in April 2020. 

I am currently working with the Visual Neuroscience Lab at McMaster for the summer of 2020 as a recipient of the James Stewart Research Support Award under the supervision of Dr. Kathryn Murphy. In this position, I have been applying machine learning techniques to big data in an attempt address questions related to the neurobiological development of the human brain.

My career objective is to apply data science methods to find innovative insights and solve real-world problems. I am particularly interested in employing my skills in fields that I am passionate about such as neuroscience, biomechanics, conservation and sustainability, and (especially) hockey.

In my spare time, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and passion of hockey with today's youth. During the 2019-20 season, I was an assistant coach for my former minor hockey club, the West Hill Golden Hawks, and a ball hockey instructor with the MLSE LaunchPad.

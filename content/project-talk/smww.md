I had the opportunity to present a talk about getting started in hockey analytics to a group of students in the Sports Management Worldwide Hockey Analytics course. In this presentation I touched on the structure of a well-built hockey analytics team, encouraged students to set goals and lay out a roadmap of where they want to go in their career, and provided some basic guidelines for how they should learn moving forward.

title: "Strong Side Data Science Series Introduction"
summary: "Have you ever been interested in learning about statistics, coding, and data science but didn't know where to start? In my series of tutorials called 'Strong Side Data Science' I will attempt to condense university-level topics in math and stats into digestible lessons with applications in R."

## What is Strong Side Data Science?

Strong Side Data Science is a set of tutorials I will be making to give back to the sports analytics community and help others get started with stats, coding, machine learning and other data-related topics. Although most of these tutorials won't touch on advanced data science topics, I used the name Strong Side Data Science as an umbrella term for anything int statistics, machine learning, computer science, and coding that I will touch upon.

There are three goals I hope to achieve with these tutorials:

- Help others who are interested in getting into hockey analytics learn some basic statistical concepts.

- Share my knowledge of any higher level algorithms and models that I learn that may be useful to industry experts.

- Strengthen my own communication skills and knowledge of data science.

For those who are just getting started and are a little bit intimidated by coding and analytics, I'd like to share a one-line quote that really helped me develop some confidence in terms of learning what I have so far in hockey analytics.

> *"Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.‚Äù - Steve Jobs*

I don't think we can take this quote too literally because I know there are definitely people that are way smarter than me and have developed statistical methods that I would've never thought of. But what we can take away from this is that every concept in math, stats, coding, etc. was created by another human being who has logically thought through their process and if it is explained in the right way, you can learn it too.


## General Format

Each SSDS tutorial will tackle the topic at hand in one or more of the following skill levels:

- Rookie: No tricky math equations, at most there will be a bit of basic math. I hope to make these accessible to everyone that has some high school math knowledge.

- Pro: Will likely require some university level math/stats skills but the equations I use won't be super complex. The methods I introduce here will be more impactful and thoroughly-explained than the rookie level but will be trickier to learn.

- Superstar: More complex topics that will likely require some higher-level undergrad or Master's data skills. These will primarily be for those with a great understanding of sports analytics and quantitative analysis. 

After providing an explanation at the given skill level(s) for the tutorial, I will go through applications of the concept in R and/or Python.

This format may differ from tutorial to tutorial based on how I feel I can best explain the concept at hand but this is my gameplan right now.
